# CLI-Labyrinth

CLI-Labyrinth is a simple maze game written in Go. I created it as a personal learning exercise for both Go programming and terminal development.

## How to Run

You can clone the repo and build Go the project, but I've also created pre-built binaries for Linux, MacOS and Windows. You can download the required binary from [itch.io](link/to/your/download)

To play CLI-Labyrinth, simply navigate to the project directory and run the executable in a Linux or macOS shell:

```bash
./cli-labyrinth
```

Please note that you'll need to make sure that the file has the executible flag set.

## Inspiration

CLI-Labyrinth was inspired by the classic 16k Sinclair ZX81 game called Labyrinth, originally written in 1981. If you enjoy maze games, it's worth checking out the originalâ€”it's much better than my "modern" version.
