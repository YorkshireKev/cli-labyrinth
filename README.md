# CLI-Labyrinth

CLI-Labyrinth is a simple maze game that runs on the Linux and MacOS terminal. I created it as a personal learning exercise for both Go programming and terminal development, using the excellent [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell) Go library.

This is my first attempt at writing a terminal game in Go, so please don't expect guru-level coding here!

## How to Download and Run

You can clone the repo and build the project using Go, but I've also created pre-built binaries for Linux, MacOS and Windows. You can download the required binary from [itch.io](lhttps://yorkshirekev.itch.io/cli-labyrinth).

To play CLI-Labyrinth, simply navigate to the project directory and run the executable in a Linux or macOS shell:

```bash
./cli-labyrinth
```

Please note that you'll need to ensure that the file has the executable flag set.

## Inspiration

CLI-Labyrinth was inspired by the classic 16k Sinclair ZX81 game called Labyrinth, originally written in 1981. If you enjoy maze games, it's worth checking out the originalâ€”it's much better than my "modern" version.
